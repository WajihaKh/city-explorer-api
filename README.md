# City Explorer Api

**Author** Wajiha Khan
**Version**: 3.0.0

## Overview

This application allows users to search for weather forecasts by city. It combines frontend and backend elements to fetch location coordinates using a third-party API and then retrieves weather forecast data from a local JSON file. The goal is to provide users with quick access to weather information for planning or general knowledge purposes.

## Getting Started

- Create a repository on GitHub and clone it locally.
- Run the command npm init to initialize a new Node.js project.
- Install the necessary dependencies (express, dotenv, cors) using npm.
- Manually add a .gitignore file to exclude node_modules and other unnecessary files from version control.
- Create a weather.json file or copy the contents of an existing one into your project directory.
- Set up a .env file to store environment variables such as the port number, ensuring that it is listed in the .gitignore file to keep sensitive information secure.
